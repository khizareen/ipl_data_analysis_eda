# ipl_data_analysis_eda
A comprehensive IPL data analysis project using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. Covers EDA on team and player performance, toss trends, season stats, boundary analysis, powerplay vs death overs, and visual insights. Built for data science learning and storytelling.

# IPL Data Analysis Project

## Objective
This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) using two datasets: `matches` and `deliveries`. The analysis answers 35 key questions related to matches, players, teams, venues, and match dynamics like toss decisions, scoring patterns, and boundaries.

## Dataset Information

- **Matches Dataset:** Contains information about each IPL match including teams, winner, toss decision, match date, and venue.
- **Deliveries Dataset:** Contains ball-by-ball level data including batsman, bowler, runs scored, dismissal details, and extras.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **NumPy**

## Key Insights

- Toss does not guarantee victory, but chasing helps in several matches.
- Certain venues offer significant home advantages.
- Some teams consistently dominate powerplay or death overs.
- Boundary runs make up over 60% of total runs in most seasons.

## How to Run

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Run the notebook ipl_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.
